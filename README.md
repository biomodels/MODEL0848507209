# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**A mathematical model of luteinizing hormone release from ovine pituitary cells in perifusion.**   
Heinze K, Keener RW, Midgley AR Jr. _Am J Physiol_ 1998 Dec;275(6 Pt
1):E1061-71 [9843750](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9843750) ,  
**Abstract:**   
We model the effect of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) on the production
of luteinizing hormone (LH) by the ovine pituitary. GnRH, released by the
hypothalamus, stimulates the secretion of LH from the pituitary. If stimulus
pulses are regular, LH response will follow a similar pattern. However, during
application of GnRH at high frequencies or concentrations or with continuous
application, the pituitary delivers a decreased release of LH (termed
desensitization). The proposed mathematical model consists of a system of
nonlinear differential equations and incorporates two possible mechanisms to
account for this observed behavior: desensitized receptor and limited,
available LH. Desensitization was provoked experimentally in vitro by using
ovine pituitary cells in a perifusion system. The model was fit to resulting
experimental data by using maximum-likelihood estimation. Consideration of
smaller models revealed that the desensitized receptor is significant.
Limited, available LH was significant in three of four chambers. Throughout,
the proposed model was in excellent agreement with experimental data.
